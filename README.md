# IP-SWEEP
Networking Basics
Based on the topology, I first used switch all over to configure the computers, but however it is vulnerable. To secure it, I then carried out network segmentation so that if my laptops in group 1 are attacked it cannot affect those in group 2. Nevertheless, with this segmentation alone, laptops in group 1 cannot communicate with laptops in group 2 when I used the ping command, so to solve the problem I then change the middle switch that connects laptops in group 1 to those in group 2 with a router which is smarter. However, the router needs to be configured by setting up IP addresses, subnet mask and bringing interface up for both groups. To do that I brought another laptop and used a console cable to connect it to the router console port with the RS232 port of my laptop which I then configured it using the Desktop terminal. After that , i then set up my gateway for both groups which allows the laptops to communicate.
Programming my IP-SWEEP:   Ping Ip,   if IP responded then host is alive, if IP did not respond then host is dead.
Coding was carried out using python as attached in my repository. I code the IP sweep in the sense that I tried to get 1 response at a time and using ">/dev/null" i made it silent. I also tried to remove response that is not needed using if res == 0 since it is pointless. I then put my response generated into a file for clarity so that it can be accessible directly without looking inside the terminal.
